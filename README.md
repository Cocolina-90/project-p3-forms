# Project 3 - HTML Forms 

The assignment was to create a form using different types of forms and send the forms to httpbin. 


## The problem

I wanted to keep on working on my page from project 2. Since it is a page about sending DVDs for free, I needed some forms anyways in order to receive orders. I will deploy it via netlify and as far as I have read, netlify offers a server for forms as well. As the information I need to collect is mainly text, setting up the forms was not that challenging. In a next step I will use Javascript to allow visitors to add their favorite DVDs by simply clicking on the "add" button. 
Last but not least, I will probably have to set up some database using MySQL - managing all DVDs directly on the page will be too tedious. So currently I am reading a bit about SQL. 

## View it live

I will deploy it as soon as the Javascript part has been added as well.
